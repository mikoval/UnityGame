I used the git hub project and expanded on what was given to us. I imported my own character that I created in Fuse, added the additional animations (all should be there). I blended them together.
I used curves for the footsteps however I had some problems with the lowest speeds but it worked decently well. 

I used an animation mask for the throwing so you can throw while running however the arms feel like they could have been done better

The scene should be the same scene given in the github project.
